World Economy Application

I want to create a web application that can be used as a quick reference identifying flags and basic economic facts of major countries for young students. This application can be used in a social studies class and could also be used to learn about countries competing in the Olympic games. 

Code Plan

When the user clicks on one of the different flags, the name of the country will come up as well as well as a short summary of the countryâ€™s government and economy.  


The types of functions I will use are: mousePressed, draw, and if/else conditions.

Input
-	Image (flag)
-	Click image
Output
-	Rectangle
-	Text
